What is cross-registration at LSPU,"Cross-registration at LSPU refers to the simultaneous registration for a semester or midyear class in more than one college within the university. To cross-register, students need to secure permission from the mother college and ensure that the course description is similar to that of the other college's subject offering. There are different cross-registration scenarios mentioned: - Within the LSPU System: Students need permission from the registrar of the campus where they are primarily enrolled. They should complete their registration on their home campus first. The total number of units or credits for cross-registration should not exceed the maximum allowed in the academic load rules. - From Another Institution: Students registered at another institution and wishing to cross-register in LSPU need to present a registrar's written permit stating the total number of units and authorized subjects. Admission is subject to the approval of the LSPU registrar. - To Another Institution: Students wishing to cross-register in another institution should seek permission/approval from the college dean and the campus registrar. They need to specify the subject/course and the number of units to be cross-enrolled to earn credits."
